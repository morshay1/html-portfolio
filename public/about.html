<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Mor Shay. I'm 25 years old, a final-year software engineering student, a cat lover and a soduko enthusiastic! I love baking, painting, going to the gym, running, racing, reading, dancing, hanging out with friends, knitting, coding, going on walks, singing and more!</p>

<p>I'm creative, thoughtful, hard-working, beautiful, funny, cute and super likeable hehe. I value deep, meaningful relationships, and prefer structured guidance when learning something new.</p>

<p>My goals in life are to make a lot of money, find love, deepen my connections with family and friends, pursue a master's degree in the software engineering field and maybe a PhD in the future. </p>
